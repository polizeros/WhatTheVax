Main site for vaccination reservations is the Southern Nevada Health District. 
https://covid.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/vaccine/distribution/

As of 2/6/21 it's First Responders and Above 70. 
IMPORTANT: If you have gotten first vaccination and have trouble booking the second appointment on the website, don't worry. They will send you an email with link to get second shot in timely manner. Things were chaotic at the start and are smoothing out. The ginormous Convention center is being used, as well as many other locations.
